    "**Objective**: Build a hybrid ensemble of weak defenses. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be creating a variant to the [Athena](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.00308.pdf) framework, using a randomized hybrid model of weak defenses. This extention will select a random set of weak defenses, where the sets have random sizes. Random weak defenses will include defenses against things such as, but not limited to: rotations, flips, shifts, filters, and compressions. The efficacy of this approach will be examined in the terms of its each defense's success, based on the time restrictions and success rate.\n"
